# LibraryTask
A simple library system built using Java, and a MySQL database.
Testing is performed using Junit and Mockito.

 The menu is in-console and no objects are used, the parameters are sent between method and the database without creating objects.
 This small task should be extended with a Frontend and APIs that call Java-Methods. Objects should be instantiated for all users, loans and books.

This project was a part of the course Quality Assurance in Information Systems at Linneus University.
